#Datatypes section
#there are many kinds of "datatypes" in python for example "a random example word" here the "a random example word" is called **String**
#and numbers are called "integars" and doshomik shonkha is called "floating point integars" like 1.32, 3.42 etc etc
#another data type is "boolean" and its value can only be true/false for example
print('test for boolean'.isalpha())
#here after we run the code **print('test for boolean'.isalpha())** we get the value false in the terminal and this "false" is the datatype called boolean
a = [1,2,'test']
print(a)
#here the [1,2,'list'] is a datatype called "list" it is basically used to store other datatypes inside of it
#there are also similliar datatype to list like "tuples and set" tuples starts with () instead of [] and set starts with {} instead of []

#Integars and floats time (they are basically just numbers with fancy names lol)

test_integar = [10+20>5]
print(test_integar)

#we can also test a datatype by using type("datatype")
print(type(23.42))
print(int(2.31))
print(float(2931))
#by using int/float/str/round etc etc datatype we can convert a datatype to THAT datatype
